# BI Engineer Tableau Take-Home

For this exercise you can use Tableau Public.  Its a free download on Tableau’s site.  The current location is:  https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/download .


## Prep for Take-Home:  
There is a python script enclosed with the zip file. It will create a directory for you and download the data for the exercise.  

Steps to get the data.  *Run in command prompt/terminal in the directory you extracted the zip file to.  Requires Python 3.4 or higher.

1. Pip install requests  
  Or  
    Pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Python get_data.py


After the scripts run you should have the following:

Base Dir
  ->Data
	  routes.csv
	  airlines.csv
	  airports.csv



## Take-Home:

Background:  
Your stakeholder for this exercise is the Global Airline Manager.  They used to get all their reports in spreadsheet format.  So they are not familiar with Tableau.  The Global Airline Manager has a couple measurements that are very important to them.

-  What is the most active airline.
-  What country has the most airlines as their home country.
-  What countries have the most routes.
-  Because wear and tear is important they also look to see what airlines have the most stops made.
  
### Task:  
With this data and background, please create dashboard(s) to take back to the manager.  During our call I will ask that you show your work and may ask how you would make changes or advance the dashboard further.  The manager would love to see a “map” of all this data but was not very clear on what that map would contain.
